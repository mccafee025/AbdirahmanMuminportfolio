  <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <p>My name is Abdirahman. I grew up in Kenya. I have been dabbling in tech for most of my life. I had finished High school in the year 2017. Since then I have been learning about tech.
        I wanted to learn more about computers which was why I decided to learn about programming so that I could make programs that could be of benefit and also to gain more knowledge in the field of technology.
